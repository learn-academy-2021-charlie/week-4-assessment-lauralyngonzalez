# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer: An instance variable in Ruby is a variable that's created from a
  class. It's different from other variables because it has data and behavior which
  are defined by the class.

2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: A block is an anonymous function in Ruby which is enclosed with do/end
  or {}. Anonymous functions are unnamed functions to perform some action. We've seen
  this a lot with iterables.

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: The 'return' keyword is not explicitly specified in Ruby. Everything is
  an object and every method returns something which makes the return implicit.

4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: OOP involves using objects to define data and behavior. OOP follows a
  set of design patterns and principles like encapsulation, inheritance and abstraction. This is different from functional programming because the logic is
  exposed and the functions can be accessed from anywhere.

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is a blueprint for an object whereas an object is an instance
  of a class. The class defines the data and behavior that each object will have,
  but the data can be different from one object to another. Two objects can behave
  similarly, but have different properties like different colors.

6. STRETCH: What is `attr_accessor`?

  Your answer: attr_accessor is a declaration that allows for some data to be accessed
  or mutated directly outside of the class.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. PostgreSQL: An object relational database management system which uses schemas or tables of rows and columns. Schemas can have relations with other schemas by having shared attributes.
 
2. Ruby on Rails: A server side web application framework built with Ruby which follows the MVC (model-view-controller) design. The model contains the data and logic, the view displays it, and the controller handles the operations for the model and view.

3. CRUD: CRUD are the operations create, read, update, and delete that are used on databases or on persistent storage. Create will create a record or data, read will get the record, update will update an existing record, and delete will remove the record.

4. ORM: ORM is object-relational mapping tool to convert data using an OOP language using SQL queries and Rails.

5. Active Record: An active record is a Rails ORM which takes data from a schema and use it like a Ruby object.
